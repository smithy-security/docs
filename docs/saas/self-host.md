# Requirements for hosting Smithy on premises

You can choose whether Smithy runs on your own cluster or in the cloud.\
If you decide to run it on-premises, we can help you set it up. All we need is a
Kubernetes namespace and a PostgreSQL
database.\
Smithy does not need admin permissions to run on your Kubernetes cluster.
