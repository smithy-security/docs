# Smithy Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

## Deployment

The docs are automatically deployed to GitHub pages, hosted at [docs.smithy.security](https://docs.smithy.security). More information can be found in the `.github/workflows/` folder.

## Writing

We [follow Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/), a systematic approach to technical documentation authoring.
